Installed properly, it enhances your curb appeal and will be enjoyed for many years to come. Like all things of great beauty, it must be treated with care. During the winter months, salt and other harsh chemicals cannot be used to add traction or melt ice. Salt is very damaging to the flagstone, the mortar joints and your garden. To maintain your beautiful flagstone, Three Little Pigs Masonry only recommends the use of coarse sand for traction during winter weather. Coarse sand can be purchased in bags from your local landscaping or masonry supplier. If you have any questions about flagstone, please call our office.'],

We drill 4-foot deep pilings, 10" in diameter and at maximum 5-foot intervals (from lowest grade level of retainer). No matter how high your retaining wall, it must have these pilings or the frost will move it. We install 15m rebar (bent to tie into horizontal rebar or mesh or both into pilings) and pour or place concrete to level of lowest grade.', 'Next, we install small 3/4" tubing at 3-foot intervals on top of footing to allow water to drain from the hydro-static pressure, but we also cover the tubing on the inside with an aggregate to ensure that the weepers do not get plugged up from soil or clay. In addition to installing active weepers, we install a water membrane on the inside. The retaining wall can be built out of stone, brick or block, the choice is yours.', 'The final component is the limestone coping that is installed on the top of the retaining wall complete with drip edges to guide water away from your retaining wall.'],

        text: ['1. Poor design at the architectural stage allowing brick to be exposed to abnormal amounts of water or moisture.', '2. The lack of, or the incorrect installation of flashing and weepers. Flashing functions to guide water out and away from the brick wall. The weepers are holes in the mortar that are installed so the water can escape and not be trapped behind the wall. Brick needs to breathe and its weepers can be plugged therefore not functioning correctly. The bricks soak up the water and deterioration begins.', '3. Bricks need protection from water. The existence of a coping stone with proper drip edges will guide water away from the brick. Window sills also need to have drip edges so the face of the brick underneath is protected. Chimneys also require a cap or coping stone to ensure that the masonry remains healthy.', '4. Brick veneer should be raised a minimum of 8" from the ground or grade level. The brick will soak up   water if continuously covered with snow. Flashing and active weepers will not help but work in conjunction with a properly constructed wall. The bottom 8" should be parged to protect the concrete foundation from the elements. Brick repair should be done upon discovery as it may lead to more extensive brick repair and other repairs due to water penetration.'],

We install 15M steel rebar into the pilings and tie this steel 15M rebar to a minimum 6 inch concrete slab. While preparing the concrete slab, wire reinforcement is also installed and tied to the 15M steel rebar for vertical reinforcement. The wire reinforcement is placed overlapping within the concrete to provide the horizontal reinforcement.', 'We pour or place the concrete and the new concrete is ready for use. Projects that include flagstone installation require s concrete curing period. We pour or place the concrete and wait a minimum of 28 days for the concrete to fully cure. Concrete must be left to cure to avoid possible cracking if stone is installed immediately. After the curing period, we return and install your natural stone or flagstone. If these steps are not followed accurately, the chance for your flagstone to crack is a very definite possibility.', 'We back up our foundation installation with a 20 year warranty.'],
